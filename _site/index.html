<h2>About the Farm</h2>

<p>
    

Based in Deerfield, Massachusetts, ELS Farm is a 90-acre certified organic, diversified family farm with its roots in the fertile soil of the Connecticut River Valley. Our produce is sold at The ELS Farm Store and to Wholesale Customers throughout New England.

We are proud of our region-wide reputation for top-quality organic produce. We harvest from our fields and greenhouses year-round and pack storage crops for sale throughout the winter months. ELS Farm strives to be a model of ecological food production, and to minimize our resource consumption and environmental impact with constant improvements to our farm systems.

            The seeds of ELS Farm first germinated in 2014, on a 90-acre plot of rented land in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Weâ€™ve grown a lot over the years, and have exciting plans for the future!<br>

            We pride ourselves on the amazing crew we have here at the farm. Most of our crew have been with us for many years, and we are always looking for more talented individuals to join our team!
            
            The ELS Farm crew is made up of dedicated part- and full-time employees. In addition to a year-round management staff and small winter crew, we hire seasonal field crews through the H-2A visa program and have had the pleasure of working alongside a core crew of team leaders since 2014.
