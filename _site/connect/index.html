            <p>We pride ourselves on the amazing crew we have here at the farm. Most of our crew have been with us for many
                years,
                and we are always looking for more talented individuals to join our team!
                The Atlas Farm crew is made up of dedicated part- and full-time employees. In addition to a year-round
                management
                staff and small winter crew, we hire seasonal field crews through the H-2A visa program and have had the
                pleasure of
                working alongside a core crew of team leaders since 2006. </p>
